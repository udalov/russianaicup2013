Results:

* Round 2 ([v17](4143d6eb9bb599fc7c127eb5b3b6516525bfb3db)) -- 28th place, 50% wins
* Finals ([v31](96cc20f4ca2eba80763e82ca14f3ac9e49a0322e)) -- 56th place, 27% wins
* Sandbox overall -- 65th place

To run local-runner from the same process from IDEA you'll need to install [Kotlin](http://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/) plugin.

To run auto tester you'll need bash and Kotlin compiler. Run `ant update` once to download the latest beta build of kotlinc, `ant` to build an executable jar suitable for auto testing, `ant src` to package the solution to zip for online judge
