- only throw grenades if enemy has a lot of health / several enemies nearby
- throw grenade in a way that will damage most of enemies (calculate damage for all possible locations)
  but don't kill myself
- if someone's in trouble and he's nearby, go help him
- don't always lower stance while shooting: if we're behind a cover, we won't see the enemy if we lie down
